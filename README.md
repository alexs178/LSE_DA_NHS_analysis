# LSE_DA_NHS_analysis
This GitHub repository contains all project files relating to analysing NHS and healthcare data.

I used read_csv and read_excel functions to import the NHS datasets into their own DataFrames. For each DataFrame, I utilised columns, shape and dtypes methods to obtain column names, number of rows and columns, and column data types. I created DataFrames using df.isna() functions to determine the number of missing values in the original DataFrames, and discovered no missing values present. For the original DataFrames, I used describe and info methods to obtain descriptive statistics and metadata. I utilised the National Categories DataFrame to count the number of locations, service settings, context types and national categories. For each column, I employed the unique method to generate a list of unique values, and the len() function to return the count of unique values. I assigned each count a variable, and used the print() function to return each count alongside an explanatory docstring. I used the same approach for Appointment Statuses in the Appointments Regional DataFrame. I discovered there are 106 locations, 5 service settings, 3 context types, 18 national categories and 3 appointment statuses (with the exception of locations, the other columns include unmapped, unknown and/or inconsistently mapped categories). To determine the five locations with the highest number of records, I employed the value_counts method to create a table of records per location, sorted from highest to lowest. I assigned a variable to this table and used the head() function to display the five locations with the highest records, and also printed an explanatory docstring.
